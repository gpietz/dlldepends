# DllDepends
A small command line tool that shows the dependencies of DLLs in a Visual Studio project. This is another learning project 
where I struggled with parsing XML files. I coded the original project last Friday at work in C# within 30 minutes, the 
port to Rust took a few hours and a few more - I didn't expect that.

This isn't feature complete yet, I'll add some updates and more information in the next days.
